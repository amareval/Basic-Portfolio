                Hey All! My background starts with being born on January 17th 1994 in Pasadena California. I grew up in a town called San Dimas on a cul-de-sac (as exciting as it gets). I grew up playing all sports but in high school played Football, Basketball, and Track. I graduated and went to USC, but originally was rejected by USC, appealed, and got in.

                    <br>
                I graduated and moved to Austin, Texas not knowing anyone but ended up making someo of my best friends out there. Then in the beginning of 2017 I was offered a job at Snapchat and moved back to Los Angeles. I love dogs but my roommates won't let me adopt one. I've been training in mixed martial arts for about a year and half and can't get enough good food.
